You must specify the qualifying path on a metric if the convergent analytic object of the metric doesn't match the  starting object in the qualifying paths of the axes and filters.   For example, consider a multi-metric query that contains metrics that count the number of applicants and requisitions,  grouped by the country of the recruiter's direct manager. The following sample shows how to use qualifyingPath to specify  the object reference traversal path from each metric's convergent analytic object to the start of the path for the axes.  In this example, there is only one convergent analytic object.  ```  \"source\": {      \"metrics\": {         \"columns\": [             {                 \"id\": \"employeeCount\"             },             {                 \"id\": \"applicantCount\",                 \"qualifyingPath\": \"Applicant.Requisition.Recruiter\"             },             {                 \"id\": \"requisitionCount\",                 \"qualifyingPath\": \"Requisition.Recruiter\"             }         ]     }  },  \"axes\": [     {         \"dimensionLevelSelection\": {             \"dimension\": {                 \"name\": \"Location\",                 \"qualifyingPath\": \"Employee.Direct_Manager\"             },             \"levelIds\": [                 \"Location_1\"             ]         }     }  ]  ```  **Note:**  * `employeeCount` doesn't need a `qualifyingPath` because it's already convergent with the start of the axis path.  * The metrics' qualifying paths must provide the reference name that resolves to the first object of the axis' qualifying path as their last path segment. In this case, Recruiter is a named reference pointing to Employee. The final qualifying paths for the metrics are:      * `employeeCount`: Employee.Direct_Manager      * `applicantCount`: Applicant.Requisition.Recruiter.Direct_Manager      * `requisitionCount`: Requisition.Recruiter.Direct_Manager", alias="qualifyingPath")
